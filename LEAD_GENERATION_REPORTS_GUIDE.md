Filter 3: Status NOT equal to "Converted"
```

### Grouping:
- **Group Rows By**: Lead Owner
- **Sort By**: Created Date (Descending)

### Add Row-Level Formula (Optional - for Lead Age calculation):
If you want to calculate lead age in days, you can add a formula column:
1. Click **Add Column** ‚Üí **Add Formula Column**
2. **Column Name**: Lead Age (Days)
3. **Formula**: `TODAY() - DATEVALUE(Lead.CreatedDate)`
4. This will show the number of days since the lead was created

### Conditional Highlighting (Recommended):
Set up conditional highlighting to visually identify leads by age:

**Where to Find It:**
1. At the bottom right of your report, click the **Conditional Formatting** link
2. OR look for the paintbrush/color palette icon in the report toolbar
3. A popup window titled "Add Conditional Formatting Rule" will appear

**How to Set It Up:**
The conditional formatting UI will show:
- **Apply Conditional Formatting to**: Select **"Sum of Lead Age (Days)"** from dropdown
- Three rows for conditions with operators: `<= *`, `> to *`, and `>`
- Background Color selectors for each row

**Configure the Rules:**

**Rule 1 - Red (0-1 Days - URGENT):**
- Operator: `<= *`
- Enter Number: **1**
- Background Color: Click the red color box (already selected)
- This will highlight leads 0-1 days old in RED

**Rule 2 - Orange/Yellow (2-3 Days - Follow Up Soon):**
- First box: Leave empty or enter **1**
- Operator: `> to *`
- Second box: Enter **3**
- Background Color: Click the orange/yellow color box
- This will highlight leads 2-3 days old in ORANGE

**Rule 3 - Green (4+ Days - Recently Created):**
- Operator: `>`
- Enter Number: **3**
- Background Color: Click the green color box
- This will highlight leads 4+ days old in GREEN

**Final Steps:**
1. Click **Done** button to save your rules
2. Click **Save & Run** to apply the formatting to your report

**Result:** Your report rows will be color-coded:
- üî¥ **Red** = Brand new leads (0-1 days) - Drop everything and contact now!
- üüß **Orange** = Recent leads (2-3 days) - Contact today
- üü¢ **Green** = Older leads (4+ days) - Follow up soon

**Note:** Make sure you've added the "Lead Age (Days)" formula column first, as the conditional formatting works on that calculated field, not on Created Date directly.

### Note:
- Use the **Created Date** column and sort descending to see newest leads first
- The **Last Activity Date** shows when the lead was last engaged
- **Last Modified Date** shows when the record was last updated by sales team

For advanced lead age tracking with bucketing, you would need to create a custom formula field on the Lead object that calculates age in days, then use that field in the report.

### Save Settings:
- **Report Name**: Lead Age and Follow-up - Fluent
- **Report Unique Name**: Lead_Age_Followup_Fluent
- **Report Folder**: Fluent Analytics
- **Description**: Tracks lead age and last activity to ensure timely follow-up on Fluent leads

**Purpose**: View leads with conversation intelligence in the Description field

### Steps to Create:
1. Navigate to **Reports** tab
2. Click **New Report**
3. Select Report Type: **Leads** (Standard)
4. Click **Continue**

### Configure Columns:
- Lead Owner
- Full Name

- Status
- Lead Source
- Created Date
- **Description** (contains conversation intelligence)
- Last Activity Date

### Add Filters:
```
Filter 1: Lead Source equals "Fluent Smart Shop"

Filter 3: Description NOT equal to "" (shows only leads with conversation data)
```

### Grouping:
- **Group Rows By**: Rating (Hot, Warm, Cold)
- **Sort By**: Created Date (Descending)

### Column Width Adjustment:
Make the **Description** column wider so you can read the full conversation intelligence:
1. Hover over the Description column header
2. Drag the column border to make it wider
3. The Description field contains the conversation summary that was written to the Lead

### What You'll See in Description Field:
The Description field contains the conversation intelligence that was automatically populated when the Lead was created, including:
- What questions the prospect asked
- Their level of interest
- Products they showed interest in
- Interaction context for sales follow-up

### Note:
Since there's no direct lookup from Leads to Fluent Conversations in the data model, the conversation intelligence is stored in the Lead's Description field when the lead is automatically created. For a full conversation history report, use the "Fluent Conversations" report type instead (Report available in Fluent Analytics section).

### Save Settings:
- **Report Name**: Lead Intelligence with Conversations - Fluent
- **Report Unique Name**: Lead_Intelligence_Conversations_Fluent
- **Report Folder**: Fluent Analytics
- **Description**: Shows leads with conversation intelligence from Fluent Smart Shop
