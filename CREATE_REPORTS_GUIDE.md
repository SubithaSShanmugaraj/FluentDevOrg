# How to Create Fluent Analytics Reports

## Prerequisites
‚úÖ Custom Report Type "Fluent Conversations" has been deployed successfully!
‚úÖ **Hour of Day** formula field has been created (calculates hour from timestamp: 0-23)

Now you can create reports through the Salesforce UI. Here's the step-by-step guide:

---

## Important Note on Time Grouping

‚ö†Ô∏è **Salesforce does not support "Hourly" grouping in reports.**

Instead, we've created a **"Hour of Day"** formula field that extracts the hour (0-23) from the timestamp. Use this field when you need to group conversations by hour.
