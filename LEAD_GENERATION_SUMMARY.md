## 📊 Lead Scoring Algorithm

### Scoring Breakdown:

| Engagement Factor | Points | Trigger |
|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Voice Interaction | 15 | Each voice conversation |
| Text Interaction | 10 | Each text conversation |
| High Intent Keyword | 20 | price, buy, purchase, order, shipping |
| Medium Intent Keyword | 10 | features, compare, reviews |
| Multiple Sessions (2+) | 15-30 | Shows sustained interest |
| Focused Product Interest | 20 | Multiple questions about same product |
| Recent Activity | 10 | Within last 7 days |

**Maximum Score**: 100 (capped)

### Intent Levels:

| Score Range | Intent Level | Lead Rating | Recommended Action |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 80-100 | Hot | Hot | Contact within 24 hours |
| 60-79 | Warm | Warm | Contact within 48-72 hours |
| 40-59 | Cold | Cold | Add to nurture campaign |
| 0-39 | Low | Cold | Monitor for future engagement |

### Lead Creation Criteria:

A lead is **automatically created** when **any** of these conditions are met:
1. ✅ Lead Score ≥ 60 (Warm or Hot)
2. ✅ 2+ High Intent Questions
3. ✅ 2+ Sessions focused on same product

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Flow:

```
User Asks Question on Fluent Smart Shop
            ↓
FluentConversationTrigger fires
            ↓
FluentConversationTriggerHandler processes (async)
            ↓
FluentLeadScoringService calculates score
            ↓
Updates Lead_Score__c and Intent_Level__c
            ↓
If qualified → FluentLeadCreationService creates Lead
            ↓
Lead enriched with conversation intelligence
            ↓
Sales team receives hot lead notification
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Quick Test:

```apex
// 1. Get current user
User currentUser = [SELECT Id, Email FROM User WHERE Id = :UserInfo.getUserId() LIMIT 1];

// 2. Get a test video
Ad_Video__c video = [SELECT Id FROM Ad_Video__c LIMIT 1];

// 3. Create high-intent conversations
List<Fluent_Conversation__c> testConvs = new List<Fluent_Conversation__c>();

for (Integer i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    testConvs.add(new Fluent_Conversation__c(
        Session_ID__c = 'test-session-' + i,
        User__c = currentUser.Id,
        User_Email__c = currentUser.Email,
        User_Question__c = 'What is the price? Do you ship internationally?',
        AI_Response__c = 'Price is $99.99. Yes, we ship worldwide.',
        Interaction_Type__c = 'Voice',
        Video__c = video.Id,
        Interaction_Timestamp__c = DateTime.now()
    ));
}

insert testConvs;

// 4. Wait a few seconds, then check results
// Check conversation scores
List<Fluent_Conversation__c> scored = [
    SELECT Id, Lead_Score__c, Intent_Level__c
    FROM Fluent_Conversation__c
    WHERE User__c = :currentUser.Id
];
System.debug('Lead Scores: ' + scored);

// Check if lead was created
List<Lead> leads = [
    SELECT Id, Email, Rating, Description, LeadSource
    FROM Lead
    WHERE Email = :currentUser.Email
    AND LeadSource = 'Fluent Smart Shop'
];
System.debug('Leads Created: ' + leads.size());
if (!leads.isEmpty()) {
    System.debug('Lead Details:');
    System.debug('  Rating: ' + leads[0].Rating);
    System.debug('  Description: ' + leads[0].Description);
}
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ All conversations have Lead_Score__c populated (e.g., 75+)
- ✅ All conversations have Intent_Level__c set (e.g., "Warm" or "Hot")
- ✅ One Lead record created with LeadSource = "Fluent Smart Shop"
- ✅ Lead has Rating = "Warm" or "Hot"
- ✅ Lead Description contains conversation intelligence
- ✅ ContentNote attached to Lead with conversation history

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Adjust Scoring Weights

private static final Integer TEXT_INTERACTION_POINTS = 10;
private static final Integer HIGH_INTENT_KEYWORD_POINTS = 20;
private static final Integer MEDIUM_INTENT_KEYWORD_POINTS = 10;
private static final Integer MULTIPLE_SESSION_POINTS = 15;
private static final Integer SAME_PRODUCT_FOCUS_POINTS = 20;
private static final Integer RECENT_ACTIVITY_POINTS = 10;
```

### Add/Remove Keywords

Edit `FluentLeadScoringService.cls` lines 23-37:

```apex
// High intent keywords (buying signals)
private static final Set<String> HIGH_INTENT_KEYWORDS = new Set<String>{
    'price', 'cost', 'buy', 'purchase', 'order', 'payment',
    'shipping', 'delivery', 'available', 'stock', 'discount',
    'warranty', 'guarantee', 'return policy', 'when can i get'
    // Add your keywords here
};

// Medium intent keywords (research phase)
private static final Set<String> MEDIUM_INTENT_KEYWORDS = new Set<String>{

    'reviews', 'ratings', 'quality', 'best', 'recommend',
    'compatible', 'work with', 'support', 'how does'
    // Add your keywords here

```

### Change Lead Qualification Criteria

Edit `FluentLeadScoringService.cls` method `shouldCreateLead()` (lines 134-143):

```apex
private static Boolean shouldCreateLead(LeadScoringResult result) {
    // Modify these conditions as needed
    return result.score >= 60 || 
           result.highIntentQuestions >= 2 ||
           (result.uniqueSessions >= 2 && result.uniqueProducts == 1);
}
```
